			<p>Newcastle United Football Club is a professional association football club based in Newcastle upon Tyne, 
			Tyne and Wear, England. The club compete in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. Since the 
			formation of the club in 1892, when Newcastle East End absorbed the assets of Newcastle West End to become 
			Newcastle United, the club has played its home matches at St James' Park. Located in the centre of Newcastle, 
			it currently has a capacity of 52,374. The club has been a member of the Premier League for all but three years 
			of the competition's history, spending 92 seasons in the top flight as of May 2024, and has never dropped below 
			English football's second tier since joining the Football League in 1893. Newcastle have won four League titles, 
			six FA Cups and an FA Charity Shield, as well as the 1968â€“69 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, the ninth-highest total of 
			trophies won by an English club.</p>

			since 1880. Throughout its history, the desire for expansion has caused conflict with local residents 
			and the local council. This has led to proposals to move at least twice in the late 1960s, and a 
			controversial 1995 proposed move to nearby Leazes Park. Reluctance to move has led to the distinctive 
			lop-sided appearance of the present-day stadium's asymmetrical stands.</p>
